# Tic-Tac-Toe: A Classic Game Built with Modern JavaScript

A classic, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built from the ground up with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. This project serves as a demonstration of core front-end development principles, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game state management.

Project Overview
The goal of this project was to solidify foundational web development skills by building a well-known game without relying on any external frameworks or libraries. The focus was on writing clean, modular, and efficient JavaScript to handle all the game logic, player turns, and win-condition checking. The user interface is designed to be clean, intuitive, and fully responsive across various screen sizes.

Tech Stack
This project is built exclusively with core web technologies:
# HTML5
# CSS3
# Javascript

Features
Interactive Gameplay: Click on any open square to place your mark.

Win Detection: The game automatically detects and announces when a player has won.

Draw Detection: The game recognizes and declares a draw when no more moves are possible.

Game Reset: A "Reset Game" button allows players to start a new game at any time.

Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Project Learnings & Reflection
Building this project was an excellent exercise in practical JavaScript application. Key takeaways include:

State Management: The importance of maintaining a clean, single source of truth for the game state (e.g., the current board, the active player) and ensuring all UI updates are derived from this state.

DOM Manipulation: Gained significant practice in selecting and manipulating DOM elements efficiently to reflect the game state without direct library assistance.

Event Handling: Implemented a robust event listening model to capture user interactions and trigger the appropriate game logic, using event delegation for better performance.

Algorithmic Thinking: Designed and implemented the algorithm for checking win conditions, which involved iterating through rows, columns, and diagonals after each move. This reinforced the process of breaking down a logical problem into programmable steps.
